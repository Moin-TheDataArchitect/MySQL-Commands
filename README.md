A step-by-step roadmap SQL Essential Data Analyst required for Data and Business Analysts.

SQL is the #1 skill

Here are the essential

SQL concepts you need to know,

  1. Basic SQL Syntax:
     
      Sorting with ORDER BY,
      
      Using to WHERE filter data,
      
      AS for aliasing columns or tables,
      
      Writing simple S E L E C T statement,
      
      Limiting results with L I M I T or TOP.

  2. Data cleaning and filtering:
     
        Using to DISTINCT filter data
     
        Using and for range filtering BETWEEN IN
     
        Pattern matching with and wildcards LIKE %
     
        * Filtering with multiple conditions using OR, AND, NOT.
        
        * Handle null values using COALESCE
          
        * Casting and converting data types
          
        * using C A S T and CONVERT
          
        * Case expressions with CASE WHEN
          
  3. Data Aggregation:
     
        Common aggregate functions:
        SUM
        AVG
        MIN
        MAX
        COUNT
        Filtering grouped data using HAVING
        Grouping data with GROUP BY
        Using nested aggregations
        (eg. AVG(SUM(sales) )
     
  4. Combining tables:
     
       * Understanding different types of joins:
        INNER JOIN
        LEFT JOIN
        RIGHT JOIN
        FULL OUTER JOIN
        SELF JOIN
        Using for Cartesian products
        CROSS JOIN
        Joining on multiple columns with composite keys
     
       * Combining datasets with:
        UNION
        UNION ALL
        EXCEPT
        INTERSECT

  5. Window Functions
     
       * Partitioning data using PARTITION BY
        Window frames for precise calculations:
        for specific row ranges
        for value-based ranges
        ROWS BETWEEN
        RANGE BETWEEN
        Basics of window functions using OVER
        Aggregates with window functions,
        like S U M and AVG

       * Window functions for ranking
        RANK
        ROW_NUMBER
        DENSE_RANK
        Window functions for navigation
        LAG
        LEAD
        NTILE
        LAST_VALUE
        FIRST_VALUE
        PERCENT_RANK

 6.Subqueries and CTEs
 
        Simple and correlated subqueries Writing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with WITH
        Recursive CTEs for hierarchical or iterative data
        Choosing between subqueries and CTEs for clarity and performance.
  
  7. Data Manipulation

        I N S E R T data into tables Understand difference between
        TRUNCATE vs D E L E T E
        U P D A T E existing records
        D E L E T E records from table
        Defining default values with constraints DEFAULT
     
  8. Query optimization
          * Using indexes effectively
          * Understanding execution plans
          * Optimizing joins and subqueries
          * Avoiding common pitfalls like
          * Redundant or Overusing correlated subqueries
              SELECT
              DISTINCT ORDER BY.
